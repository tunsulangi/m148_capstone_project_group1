## Exploratory Data Analysis

`EDA_compiled.ipynb`:  This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the compiled dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and key characteristics. The analysis includes data cleaning, summary statistics, outlier detection, and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.  

### 1. **Data Distribution Analysis**  
- Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation are computed.  
- The presence of missing values is checked.  

### 2. **Outlier Detection**  
- The dataset is examined for outliers using statistical measures.  
- Boxplots and histograms are used to visualize outliers.  

### 3. **Feature Analysis and Correlations**  
- Relationships between numerical features are explored using correlation matrices.  
- Heatmaps are generated using `seaborn` to highlight correlated variables.  

### 4. **Data Visualization**  
- Various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots, are created to better understand feature distributions.  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are used for visualizations.  

### 5. **Handling Missing Data**  
- Strategies such as imputation or dropping missing values are used.  
  

## Model Development and Results

`M148_model_development.ipynb`: This notebook develops a machine learning model to predict apartment rental prices based on various features. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using regression techniques. 

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
- Encoding categorical features using `OneHotEncoder`.  
- Standardizing numerical features using `StandardScaler`.  

### 2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**  
- Identifying relevant variables for the model.  
- Creating new features if necessary.  

### 3. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**  
- Splitting data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.  
- Training models.
- Using `GridSearchCV` to optimize hyperparameters.  

### 4. **Model Evaluation**  
- Assessing model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and $R^2$.  
- Visualizing model predictions versus actual values.  

### Running the Notebook  
1. Ensure the dataset (`no_nas_master_dataset.csv`) is available in the working directory.  
2. Run all cells sequentially to execute the analysis and train the model.
